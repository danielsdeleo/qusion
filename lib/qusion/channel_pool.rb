  # ChannelPool maintains a pool of AMQP channel objects that can be reused.
  # The motivation behind this is that if you were to use MQ.new to create a
  # new channel for every request, your AMQP broker could be swamped trying to
  # maintain a bunch of channels that you're only using once.
  #
  # To use the channel pool, just replace <tt>MQ.new</tt> in your code with <tt>Qusion.channel</tt>
  #
  #   # Instead of this:
  #   MQ.new.queue("my-worker-queue")
  #   # Do this:
  #   Qusion.channel.queue("my-worker-queue")
  #
  # By default, ChannelPool maintains a pool of 5 channels. This can be adjusted with
  # <tt>ChannelPool.pool_size=()</tt> or <tt>Qusion.channel_pool_size()</tt>
  # The optimal pool size is not yet known, but I suspect you might need a
  # larger value if using Thin in production, and a smaller value otherwise.
